# RPS-Multiplayer

## Overview

This game allows two users from two different windows to two different countries or time zones to play each other in rock/paper/scissors. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Firebase Database

## How it Works

Enter your name and click on `Join a game!`. When two players have joined, Player 1 can pick rock, paper, or scissors before Player 2 can pick. The result of the game will automatically display once both players have picked. The score will be tallied until one of the two players disconnects. 

There is also a chat feature that will persist continuously, whether the window is refreshed or not. The name in the chat will only appear if you typed something and joined a game.
